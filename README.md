# Unreal Generated Stuffs
Screwing around with generated stuff in unreal

## What do?
There is a square. When you run through it, it splits based off of where you started and ended.  
Obviously it's supposed to be a weapon splitting the square, but I don't know how to do that yet,  
leaving the default character model to initiate the splitting.  
(Oh, it also takes out chunks of the square based off of how wide the splitting object is)

## What do next?
* Create a cube from 6 squares
* Create new faces when splitting the cube
* Allow for partial splitting and stabbing
* Link cubes together to form a chain
* Make chain move by expanding/contracting cubes
* Make code pretty
